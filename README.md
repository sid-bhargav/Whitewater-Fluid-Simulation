# Whitewater-Fluid-Simulation

## Using my blend file

I wanted to try to create a fluid simulation in Blender that was more realistic. Unfortunately the simulation cache file turned out to be very large, so I've decided not to add that. My simulation settings have all been plugged in and you can downscale whatever you chose. 

If you want to save on bake time I recommend not baking foam because I actually chose not to use it in my final render. The spray also turned to be very large (about 20gb) so I would recommend bringing down the resolution divisions in the liquid particle bake if you'd like to save on space.
